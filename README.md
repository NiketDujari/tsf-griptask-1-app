# The Sparks Foundation Grip Task-1

A new Flutter application.

## Social Media Integration

This is GRIP Task-1 of Mobile App Dvelopment Internship of The Sparks Foundation. We had to integrate atleast 2 Social media platforms (Google, Facebook, etc) to our app, so that when the user logs in, he can see his basic info like Name, email, profile picture,etc.
